Project 1: RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor Implementation Project

This project involves extending a basic RISC-V single-cycle processor implementation to support additional instructions, specifically the addi (add immediate) and jal (jump and link) instructions. The provided code skeleton includes a complete RISC-V processor implementation with certain instruction types already supported, but requires modifications to handle these additional instruction formats correctly.

Project 2: RISC-V Pipelined Processor Implementation Project

This project consists of modifying a pipelined RISC-V processor implementation in SystemVerilog, which initially lacks a hazard detection unit. The goal is to adapt the code so that it can correctly execute the instructions from the provided testbench, by implementing hazard handling mechanisms such as forwarding, stalling, and flushing. These mechanisms ensure correct behavior in the presence of data and control hazards, allowing the pipelined processor to function as expected.
