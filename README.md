## RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor Implementation Project
#### Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil

Project 1:
This project involves extending a basic RISC-V single-cycle processor implementation to support additional instructions, specifically the addi (add immediate) and jal (jump and link) instructions. The provided code skeleton includes a complete RISC-V processor implementation with certain instruction types already supported, but requires modifications to handle these additional instruction formats correctly.
